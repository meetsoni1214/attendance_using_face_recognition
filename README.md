# attendance_using_face_recognition
This project is used for making attendance using facing recognition in Python. 

First, put in all the images of students who you want to take attendance. And then clear the attendance.csv file. Finally, run the Python program. Make sure your webcam is active. 
If you want to exit from marking the attendance, press 'q' from the keyword.
